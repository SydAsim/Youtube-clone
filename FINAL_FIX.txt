FINAL FIX FOR RENDER 404 ISSUE
================================

The "route not found" message is coming from RENDER'S SERVER, not your React app.
This means Render is NOT serving your index.html for all routes.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Your Render service is likely configured as a "Web Service" instead of "Static Site"
OR the _redirects file isn't being recognized.

SOLUTION:
---------

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find: youtube-clone-frontend-9y0g
3. Check the service type badge

IF IT SAYS "WEB SERVICE":
   - DELETE this service
   - Create NEW "Static Site" (not Web Service!)
   
IF IT SAYS "STATIC SITE":
   - Go to Settings
   - Verify EXACT settings:
     * Root Directory: frontend
     * Build Command: npm install && npm run build
     * Publish Directory: dist
   - Save and redeploy

CRITICAL: The service MUST be "Static Site" type!

After fixing, commit these changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix _redirects format"
git push

Then test: https://youtube-clone-frontend-9y0g.onrender.com/login
Should show login page, not "route not found"
